This is the main mod for the Farming Simulator Telemetry project.

Zip content and place in your FS "mods" folder.

Needs to be connected to the Server application, which you can find here: https://github.com/upsidedownLS13/FS_Telemetry_Server

For compatibility and ease of maintenance it is suggested you do not make any changes to this mod, but use the addon functionality instead. An example addon mod can be found here: https://github.com/upsidedownLS13/FSTelemetry_FillLevel_Addon

Have fun building, driving and farming! :)
